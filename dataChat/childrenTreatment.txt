Most children with TB can be treated with isoniazid and rifampin for 6 months, along with pyrazinamide for the first 2 months if the culture from the source case is fully susceptible.

For postnatal TB, many experts increase the treatment duration to 9 or 12 months because of the possible impaired immune system in children younger than 12 months. The Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine is not recommended in infants in the United States but is commonly used worldwide.

Isoniazid tablets may be crushed and added to food. Isoniazid liquid without sorbitol should be used to avoid osmotic diarrhea, which can cause decreased absorption.

Rifampin capsules may be opened, and the powder added to food. If rifampin is not tolerated, it may be taken in divided doses 20 minutes after light meals.

Ethambutol often is avoided in young children because of difficulties monitoring visual acuity and color perception. However, studies show that ethambutol (15 mg/kg) is well tolerated and can prevent further resistance if the child is infected with a resistant strain.

Bedaquiline is also a consideration as part of a 4-drug regimen for multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in children aged 5 years or older when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be provided.
