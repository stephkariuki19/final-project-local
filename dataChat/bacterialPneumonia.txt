Bacterial pneumonia
Practice Essentials
Bacterial pneumonia (see the image below) is caused by a pathogenic infection of the lungs and may present as a primary disease process or as the final, fatal disorder primarily in an individual who is already debilitated. The most consistent presenting symptom of bacterial pneumonia is cough productive of sputum.
 Antibiotic treatment is the mainstay of drug therapy for bacterial pneumonia
 Signs and symptoms of bacterial pneumonia
Cough, particularly cough productive of sputum, is the most consistent presenting symptom of bacterial pneumonia and may suggest a particular pathogen, as follows:

Streptococcus pneumoniae: Rust-colored sputum

Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and pneumococcal species: May produce green sputum

Klebsiella species pneumonia: Red currant-jelly sputum

Anaerobic infections: Often produce foul-smelling or bad-tasting sputum

Signs of bacterial pneumonia may include the following:

Hyperthermia (fever, typically >38°C) [1] or hypothermia (< 35°C)

Tachypnea (>18 respirations/min)

Use of accessory respiratory muscles

Tachycardia (>100 bpm) or bradycardia (< 60 bpm)

Central cyanosis

Altered mental status

Physical findings may include the following:

Adventitious breath sounds, such as rales/crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes

Decreased intensity of breath sounds

Egophony

Whispering pectoriloquy

Dullness to percussion

Tracheal deviation

Lymphadenopathy

Pleural friction rub

Examination findings that may indicate a specific etiology include the following:

Bradycardia: May indicate a Legionella etiology

Periodontal disease: May suggest an anaerobic and/or polymicrobial infection

Cutaneous nodules: May suggest Nocardia infection

Decreased gag reflex: Suggests risk for aspiration

See Clinical Presentation for more detail.

Diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia
Severity assessment

Tools to assess the severity of disease and risk of death include the PSI/PORT (ie, pneumonia severity index/Patient Outcomes Research Team score), the CURB-65 (ie, confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age >65 years) system, and the APACHE (ie, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation), among others.

The following laboratory tests are also useful for assessing illness severity:

Serum chemistry panel

Arterial blood gas (ABG) determination

Venous blood gas determination (central venous oxygen saturation)

Complete blood cell (CBC) count with differential

Serum free cortisol value

Serum lactate level

Sputum evaluation

Sputum Gram stain and culture should be performed before initiating antibiotic therapy. A single predominant microbe should be noted at Gram staining, although mixed flora may be observed with anaerobic infection caused by aspiration.

Imaging studies

Chest radiography: The criterion standard for establishing the diagnosis of pneumonia

Chest computed tomography scanning

Chest ultrasonography

Bronchoscopy

Lung tissue can be visually evaluated and bronchial washing specimens can be obtained with the aid of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Protected brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be performed for fluid analysis and cultures.

Thoracentesis

This is an essential procedure in patients with a parapneumonic pleural effusion. Analysis of the fluid allows differentiation between simple and complicated effusions.

Pathogen-specific tests

Urine assays

Sputum, serum, and/or urinary antigen tests

Immune serologic tests

Histologic examination

Histologic inflammatory lung changes vary according to whether the patient has lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, or interstitial pneumonia. [2]

See Workup for more detail.

Management of bacterial pneumonia
The mainstay of drug therapy for bacterial pneumonia is antibiotic treatment. First-line antimicrobials for S pneumoniae, the most prevalent cause of bacterial pneumonia, are, for the penicillin-susceptible form of the bacterium, penicillin G and amoxicillin. For the penicillin-resistant form of S pneumoniae, first-line agents are chosen on the basis of sensitivity.

Supportive measures include the following:

Analgesia and antipyretics

Chest physiotherapy

Intravenous fluids (and, conversely, diuretics), if indicated

Pulse oximetry with or without cardiac monitoring, as indicated

Oxygen supplementation

Positioning of the patient to minimize aspiration risk

Respiratory therapy, including treatment with bronchodilators and N-acetylcysteine

Suctioning and bronchial hygiene

Ventilation with low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) in patients requiring mechanical ventilation secondary to bilateral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3]

Systemic support: May include proper hydration, nutrition, and mobilization
