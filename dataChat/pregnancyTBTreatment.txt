Treatment During Pregnancy
Pregnant patients with active TB should be treated, even in the first stage of pregnancy. Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol may be used. In the United States, pyrazinamide is reserved for women with suspected multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Elsewhere in the world, pyrazinamide is commonly used in pregnant individuals with TB. Streptomycin should not be used because it has been shown to have harmful effects on the fetus.

Preventive treatment is recommended during pregnancy, especially in the following types of patients:

Pregnant patients with a positive tuberculin skin test result who are HIV seropositive or who have behavioral risk factors for HIV infection but who decline HIV testing

Pregnant individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test result who have been in close contact with a patient who is smear-positive for pulmonary TB

Pregnant patients who had a documented tuberculin skin test conversion during the previous 2 years

Pregnant individuals are at an increased risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity and should undergo monthly alanine aminotransferase (ALT) monitoring while on treatment. This risk continues 2-3 months into the postpartum period. Pyridoxine should also be administered to pregnant patients receiving isoniazid.

Breastfeeding can be continued during preventive therapy. Many experts recommend supplemental pyridoxine for the breastfed infant.

Lin et al reported that individuals diagnosed with TB during pregnancy are at an increased risk of having children who are of low birth weight and are small for their gestational age. However, preterm birth was not more common in pregnant individuals with TB. [146]
